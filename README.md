API Testing For Fun 

## Exercise Tests - JSONPlaceholder API
### Description:
This project contains a set of unit and integration tests for exercises that make use of the open-source JSONPlaceholder API. 
The JSONPlaceholder API provides data to simulate common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on posts, users, comments, and more in JSON format.

### How to Use the JSONPlaceholder API
The JSONPlaceholder API is publicly available and can be used without authentication. Here are some examples of how to use it:

To retrieve a list of all users, you can make a GET request to the following URL:  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.

To retrieve a list of posts for a specific user (e.g., with ID 1), you can make a GET request to this URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1.

To create a new post, you can make a POST request to this URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts and pass the data in JSON format.
